// VERY EASY: Create two variables and assign a number to each. Console log the difference between the numbers. Example output: “The difference between 6 and 2 is 4”


var value1 = 6;
var value2 = 2;
var value3 = value1 - value2;

console.log("The difference between " + (value1) + " & " + (value2) + " is " + (value3))
